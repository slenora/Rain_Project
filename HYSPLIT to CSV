files = dir('PRECIP*');  % Your mini directory. Easily acess directory


for p = 1:length(files) % it will loop through the entire amount of files
    p  % This is a counter, will show up on screen and tell you what iteration you are on
    tic % This is a time counter and tells you how long a code btook from tic to toc
    fid = fopen(files(p).name,'r'); % this will open the file at p iteration to read, 'r'
    trip = 0;

    % information in each file and will save only the relavant numeric data
    % as a .csv file
